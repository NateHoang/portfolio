      <h1>Interest</h1>
      <p>
        I like to learn new things whether it be in coding, or life lessons. I
        am always looking for new opportunities to make me a better person and
        what I love to do. I also like to spend time with my family and friends
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever I have free time and am not coding, I like to play games, try
        new recipes, go to the gym, hike, play my clarinet, rock climb,
        futures/option trading, and catch up on shows and movies.
      </p>
    </div>
